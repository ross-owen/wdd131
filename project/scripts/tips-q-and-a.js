    "question": "What is a wedge?",
    "abbreviation": "Wedge?",
    "answers": [
        "Loft: Wedges have the highest loft among irons, which means the clubface is more angled upwards. This loft helps the ball launch higher in the air and travel shorter distances with more control.",
        "Shaft: Wedge shafts are typically shorter than those of longer irons. This allows for more precise control over the clubhead during impact.",
        "Clubhead: Wedge clubheads can be slightly heavier than other irons. The added weight can help generate more power for short approach shots.",
        "Pitching Wedge (PW): The most common wedge, used for a variety of chip shots, pitch shots, and full approaches.",
        "Sand Wedge (SW): Designed for getting the ball out of sand bunkers. The clubface has more grooves to help grip the sand and propel the ball out.",
        "Gap Wedge (AW): A relatively new invention that fills the gap in yardage between a pitching wedge and a sand wedge.",

    ]
}, {
    "question": "What is an iron?",
    "abbreviation": "Irons? Heavy metal?",
    "answers": [
        "Function: Irons are primarily used to propel the ball towards the green, especially on approach shots from the fairway or rough. They can also be used from the teeing ground on shorter holes, or even to get out of hazards like sand traps.",
        "Design: Irons typically have shorter shafts and smaller clubheads than woods (another type of golf club). The clubhead is made of steel and has a large, flat face with grooves that  help control the ball's spin and trajectory.",
        "Numbers and Lofts: Irons are designated by numbers (usually 3 through 9) which correspond to the loft angle of the clubface. Lower numbers (long irons) have less loft and travel farther, while higher numbers (short irons) have more loft and travel shorter distances but with more control.",
        "Set Composition: A standard set of irons will usually contain 7 to 11 irons, though some golfers may opt for a modified set that excludes long irons which can be difficult to hit. Wedges, which are specialty irons with even higher lofts for short-distance shots around the green, are often included in a complete iron set."
    ]
}, {
    "question": "What is a wood?",
    "abbreviation": "Woodie from Toy Story?",
    "answers": [
        "Function:  Their primary purpose is to launch the ball farther compared to other clubs like irons. Woods are ideal for long approach shots or hitting off the tee on par 4s and 5s.",
        "Design: Traditionally, woods were made from hardwood (hence the name), but today's woods have metal clubheads, typically made from titanium for strength and lightness.  They have longer shafts and larger, rounder heads compared to irons.",
        "Driver (1-wood): This has the lowest loft (around 9-13 degrees) and the largest clubhead of all woods. It's used for the absolute longest shots, typically off the tee.",
        "Fairway Woods (numbered 3-wood, 5-wood, 7-wood etc.): These have progressively higher lofts (as the number increases) than the driver, resulting in a more controlled trajectory but slightly less distance. They can be used from the fairway for long second shots or even off the tee for tighter holes.",
        "Modern Materials: Though the term 'wood' remains, the clubs themselves are no longer made of wood.  Modern woods are constructed from various materials like titanium or composite materials for better performance."
