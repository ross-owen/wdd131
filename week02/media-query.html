        <h2>D&C 9:6-9</h2>
        <p>6 Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this manner.</p>
        <p>7 Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought
            save it was to ask me.</p>
        <p>8 But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right,
            and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is
            right.</p>
        <p>9 But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall
            cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be
            given you from me.</p>
